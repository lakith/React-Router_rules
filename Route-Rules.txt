1) Only the main componets of the routes get route parameters. 
   Child or sub components dosent recive route props.
   But You Can pass parent route parameters to child componets as below
	
	* You have to Use a higer order component 
		- import {withRouter} from 'react-router-dom'
		
		- export default withRouter(child);
	  Now the cheild componets get route parametrs. 

2) React route uses an regxp to match route paths.Therefore route paths like '/' will match for all routes. To avoid that
   you can either use 'exact' inside 'Route' or you can use switch.
	If you are using Switch it only matches a one route path. But you have to order the route paths in a proper manner.


3) Nested Routing.
	If you want to use nested routing inside another component, like if you want to display a post content by clicking its title
	Under that title, You can use nested routing.
	
	Then you have to define that router on that component.
	
	eg in posts component
		
		class Posts extends Component {
		
			render(){
				return(
					<div> 
						......					
						<Route path="posts/:id" component={Post}>
					<div>
				)
			}
		
		}

4) Navigating Programmatically.
	Then You have to pass the route path to the history prop.
		
	 	eg -> this.props.history.push({pathname:'/posts/'+id});
		
		Also you have following methods
			 this.props.history.goBack(); - Go back to the previous route
			 this.props.history.replace('/checkout/content-data'); - navigate to a diffreant route


5) access quary parameters.

		encode quary params
		
			const quaryParams = [];
			for(let i in this.state.ingrediants){
			    console.log(i);
			    quaryParams.push(encodeURIComponent(i) + '=' + encodeURIComponent(this.state.ingrediants[i]));
			}

			const quaryString = quaryParams.join('&')
			this.props.history.push({
			    pathname:'/checkout',
			    search: '?' + quaryString
			})
		
		
		retrive quary params
		eg-> const query = new URLSearchParams(this.props.location.search);
		
		************* retriving list of quary params************
		const query = new URLSearchParams(this.props.location.search);
		const ingrediants= {};
		for(let param of query.entries()){
		    // ['salad', '1']
		    ingrediants[param[0]] = +param[1]; // typecasting to number
		}
		this.setState({ingrediants:ingrediants})
